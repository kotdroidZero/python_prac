#String operations
# 1. len(string) Returns the length of the string
# 2. for character in string Iterates over each character in the string
# 3. if substring in string Checks whether the substring is part of the string
# 4. string[i] Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero
# 5. string[i:j] Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(string) by default.


#String methods
# 1. string.lower() / string.upper() Returns a copy of the string with all lower / upper case characters
# 2. string.lstrip() / string.rstrip() / string.strip() Returns a copy of the string without left / right / left or right whitespace
# 3. string.count(substring) Returns the number of times substring is present in the string
# 4. string.isnumeric() Returns True if there are only numeric characters in the string. If not, returns False.
# 5. string.isalpha() Returns True if there are only alphabetic characters in the string. If not, returns False.
# 6.string.split() / string.split(delimiter) Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace / delimiter
# 7. string.replace(old, new) Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.
# 8. delimiter.join(list of strings) Returns a new string with all the strings joined by the delimiter






# The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others. Each of the three values can be expressed as an octal number summing each permission, with 4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute. Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted.
#  For example: 
#  640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be: "rw-r-----"
#  755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x"
#  Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format.
