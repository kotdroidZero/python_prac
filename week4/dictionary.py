# Dictionaries are another data structure in Python. Theyâ€™re similar to a list in that they can be used to organize data into collections. However, data in a dictionary isn't accessed based on its position. Data in a dictionary is organized into pairs of keys and values. You use the key to access the corresponding value. Where a list index is always a number, a dictionary key can be a different data type, like a string, integer, float, or even tuples.


#Iteration in dict

for ext in x:
    print(ext)


# items() method to get Key_Value Pair
for ext,count in x.items():
    print("There are {} file with .{} extension".format(count,ext))


# keys() method to get keys
print(x.keys())    

# values() method to get values
print(x.values())    

for value in x.values():
    print(value)
